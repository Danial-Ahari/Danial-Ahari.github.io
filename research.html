				<p>Although I am currently only an undergraduate, I have been introduced to research early in my academic career and shown how research is conducted both at my level and at the higher level. One of my current research interests is associated with the niche field of data recovery and archival storage. It is an underserved branch of computational science that has largely not had the attention it required from the field. There exists a need for new, living methods and standards for recovering analogue data, aging digital data, and digital data to come in the future, in practical, easy-to-use, and easy-to-manage ways, established in a way that does not require a professional in computers to facilitate. Although in the general community, some progress has been made toward standardizing digital preservation, particularly in the videogame preservation field, there is little academic work on the topic, and to achieve any lasting justification for digital preservation, it must be made into a process than any archives or special collections can implement, and have the data stored in a way that makes it practical for both preservation and storage. Tangentially related are compression algorithms, storage technologies, and archival science.</p>
				<p>Besides this, I haven't yet had the time in my academic career to think deeply about research topics. I hope that, by virtue of talking with professors and graduate researchers, I will be able to acquire information about other research topics as I enter higher levels of education. Though I may not be interested in every research topic, all research is ultimately useful. There is no such knowledge that we need not know, as all of it will eventually become useful. If not academically, then in some general field, perhaps 20 or 30 or 40 years down the road. I can name numerous times I found academic and non-academic articles from the 1990s that assisted me in working academically and non-academically today. That is the nature of research, a living, breathing, field, that assists not only you, and the present, but also all that will come after you, and the future.</p>
